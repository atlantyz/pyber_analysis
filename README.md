* What did this analysis reveal about the number of drivers by city type?
The city type with the highest number of drivers is the urban city type. The city type with the least number of drivers is the rural city type. 

* What did this analysis reveal about the the total fare amount by city type?
The city type with the highest total fares is the urban city type. The city type with the lowest total fares is the rural city type. 

* What did this analysis reveal about the average fare per ride by city type?
The city type with the highest average fare per ride is the rural city type. The city type with the lowest average fare per ride is the urban city type. 

* What did this analysis reveal about the average fare per driver by city type?
The city type with the highest average fare per driver is the rural city type. The city type with the lowest average fare per driver is the urban city type. 

## Summary

The results of this analysis reveal the impact of city type on ride sharing. While rural communities have a smaller amount of drivers than urban communities, drivers in the rural community, on average, receive more money per ride than urban drivers. However, due to the number of rides urban drivers carry out, the urban city type still has the highest total fares. 

### Recommendations

To address disparities among the city types:

1. Increase the number of drivers in rural communities. 
2. Decrease the number of drivers in urban communities. 
3. Increase the number of advertised destinations in rural communities.
